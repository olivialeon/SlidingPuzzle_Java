// class is a keyword to describe a block of text start enclosed in { and } that has a name such as "RedButtonGUI". 
// A class can benefit from another existing class by saying it "extends" another class, here this class is JPanel.
// Inheritance means that RedButtonGUI obtains or "inherits" all code that is in the JPanel class.
// RedButtonGUI can then 
// a) extend the JPanel code by adding further attributes or methods to or
// b) vary an inherited method from JPanel by providing a new method of same signature (signature=methodname+parameters)

	// it would be located more towards the bottom and the constructor method(s) would come first.
	// The main method is a natural starting point to start the execution of a program.
	// In Java each class can provide its own main method if one likes to do this
	// but usually very few classes in a code base have a main method.
	// It is always
	// public: which means anyone can call it from outside
	// static: which means one can call this method without instantiating an object of type RedButtonGUI
	// void: which means that the method does not return any result values

	///////////// class internal attributes ////////////////
	// The following variables are declared within the scope of the class.
	// This means each instance of this class,i.e. object, has its own private, individual set of these variables.
	// The values settings for its attributes constitute the "state" of an object.
	// For this example we define
	private Color color ; // a reference to a Color object in order to memorize the color setting of our button
	private JButton button ; // a reference to a Button object that this class puts on the screen
	private int count = 0; // a counter that remembers how often our button was clicked, it is initialized to zero
	// note that one can initialize variables like count with an assignment or one can leave this out.
	// Also note that in Java (different from many other languages) variables like color and button are
	// automatically initialized with null (zero) values unless we assign a particular value (as for count).


	
	////////// class specific methods //////////////////////

	 * Constructor creates graphic component, a button and adds it to the JPanel this class inherits from.
	 */
	// a constructor is a method that has the class name as its method name. It can have a parameters but 
	// it does not return anything.
	// a constructor method can be public = accessible from anywhere outside of the class 
	// or private = accessible only from inside the class which is unusual (see Singleton Pattern for an example)
	// The purpose of a constructor method is to initialize internal class attributes such that an object
	// after instantiation is fully functional and ready to use, it is in a valid initial state
	public RedButtonGUI() {
		// see above, our variables are count which is already initialized to zero, button and color.
		// we are not happy with null as a value for button, so
		// we instantiate a button object of class JButton by calling its default constructor
		button = new JButton();
		// we want to have our own code being executed if the user clicks the button
		// the way to do this is to program code for an ActionListener (see Listener class below)
		// we instantiate a listener object
		// and then register it with the button
		ActionListener listener = new Listener(); // instantiation of the listener
		button.addActionListener(listener); // registration of listener with the button
		// now we have a usable button and add it to the overall screen, which is the JPanel that
		// this RedButtonGUI class is and extends.
		// so add(Object) is a method that our class inherits from JPanel thanks to the "extends JPanel" 
		// statement on top of the class
		add(button) ;
		// at this point, attribute color == null which is not necessarily a problem 
		// but let's give it default color to make sure our RedButtionGUI object is fully functional
		color = Color.CYAN ; // the chosen color has no deeper meaning and is for demonstration purposes.

	// public = method can be called from outside with the .notation, e.g. myvar.setColor("pink") 
	// if myvar is a variable the references (points to) a RedButtonGUI object
	// the method sets the internal color attribute and the text label shown on the button 
	public void setColor(String string) {
		// "red" will become a reference to String object 
		// equals(Object) is a method of the String class and it compares 2 strings based on their content
		// note that a comparison like ("red" == string) is possible as well but has a different meaning
		// == compares addresses or memory locations which is not what we want here.
		// The boolean condition below should be true if the string variable points to string that has "red" as its value
		// regardless where that string resides in memory
		if ("red".equals(string)) {
			color = Color.RED ; // we assign one of the existing color constants from the existing Color class.
			button.setText("RED BUTTON"); // we configure the text label on the button 
		}
		// below is the corresponding case for green.
		// note that we switched the roles of the strings. 
		// This is equivalent to "green".equals(string) if string is not null. 
		// For the special case of a variable that does not refer to a valid string
		// i.e. it points to "null", calling a method such as equals() on a null reference is not valid
		// and causes a runtime exception (the infamous Null Pointer Exception) and the 
		// program typically stops its execution.
		// The code below is also an example if nested if then else if statements.
		else if (string.equals("green")) {
			color = Color.GREEN ; // analogously to case for red above
